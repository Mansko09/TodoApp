# TodoApp
A Simple and Intuitive Task Manager

This is a web-based Todo application built to help users organize their tasks efficiently. Designed with a focus on simplicity and usability, this project is part of my journey in learning and improving my web development skills. It includes features like task creation, editing, deletion, and marking tasks as complete â€” all within a responsive and user-friendly interface.
